        This site is built as a growing MERN learning journal: a React frontend
        with routing today, and room to add a real Express API and MongoDB
        backend as the stack matures. The goal is honest, beginner-friendly
        guidance on full-stack habits—small projects, clear architecture, and
        steady progress across the whole stack, not only the topics covered in
        the articles published so far.
